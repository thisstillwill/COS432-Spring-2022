1-Word Passwords:


Distributed

We found this password by using the list of the most common 100,000 English words and the bruteforce-luks tool to look for the password that decrypted the encrypted partition of the suspect's disk. We used the following terminal command to accomplish this: 

sudo bruteforce-luks -t 6 -f wiki-100k.txt /dev/sdb2. 


themselves

We found this password for decrypting chatlog files in the .bash-history file in /mnt2/home/bob.

We found an encrypted chat log file (chatlog1.txt.enc) in /mnt2/home/bob/.irc that contains this token and a conversation between Alice and Bob that describes the information of a "target" individual. This file also describes a special method used to encrypt another chat log file in order to confuse potential prying eyes. We were able to decrypt this encrypted file by using the compile.sh and decrypt.sh files in the folder and the "themselves" password.

We found a sqlite database file (places.sqlite) in /mnt2/home/bob/.mozilla/firefox/rs9p00c.default.

One of the tabs corresponded to a Google search by Bob about being framed for murder and contained this token.

Transaction IDs:

In /home/bob/.bitcoin on the encrypted partition, we found a file named wallet.dat with the following contents:

	L1JHBR39uUVVvU27SFmYdA6SAmCdGYHYSLPYrMVgGfDZSACrmaPy

This is the private key of a bitcoin wallet. We found the corresponding Bitcoin Address by pasting the private key into https://www.bitaddress.org/:

	12Wn1oSUfLa2ayXw9MGXm9rHbKjY5w1PST

We entered the address into the Bitcoin Explorer on https://www.blockchain.com/explorer, and found two Bitcoin transaction IDs associated with the address:

	8eb9adc9e1d4237ee8da2998eb954683b955fc675e1c327c3494426b4da09813
