# COS 432 Spring 2022

This repository contains my assignment submissions for [COS 432/ECE 432 Information Security](https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/teaching/ece432-spring22/index.html). The course was a broad overview of topics relating to information security:

> How to secure computing systems, communications, and users. Basic cryptography; private and authenticated communication; software security; malware; operating system protection; network security; web security; physical security; cryptocurrencies and blockchains; privacy and anonymity; usable security; economics of security; ethics of security; legal and policy issues.

The first three assignments were individual and focused on implementing cryptographic algorithms in Java. The second half of the course involved broader applications of information security during group assignments.
